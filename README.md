# Get Credit

- I wrote a bot program for websites that the more credits you earn, the more followers and likes you can gain. The bot helps you earn credits by going to the relevant website and watching videos in the background. In order to convert these credits into followers or likes, you need to go to the website manually from your browser and make the definitions.

# Remarks

When you get expiration error on get_instagram_followers.py or get_instagram_likes.py programs, please change your Instagram username and start the bot again.

Although you change your username and still get expiration error, please try VPN and start the bot again. For example: Hotspot Shield Free VPN program.
